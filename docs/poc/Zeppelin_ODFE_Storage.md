# **Custom ODFE Storage in Zeppelin**

### **Requirement:**

- Use Zeppelin as a backend service for Kibana Notebooks and store notebooks as ODFE indices
- Use Zeppelin’s storage adaptor interface and implement a new storage adaptor using Elasticsearch Client

### **Design:**

- [“Transport client API“](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/current/transport-client.html) is getting deprecated in favor of high level client.
- Finalized, [“High level client API”](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/7.8/java-rest-high.html) for ease of use and minimal operations needed for Adaptor.
- Notebooks will be indexed as* .notebooks/\_doc/{Unique_id} →* Unique ID is generated by zeppelin

### **Design Details:**

1. Implements the interface common for all Zeppelin Storage adaptors
2. Implementation of functions in ODFE Zeppelin storage adaptor:

   - Init - Get all config params
   - List - List all notebooks
   - Get - fetch a notebook
   - save - save a notebook
   - remove - a note
   - close - client connection
   - Upgrade client to Https requests - Done using keystore

### **Usage:**

1. POC for ODFE adapter https://github.com/ps48/zeppelin/tree/dev-odfe
2. TODO: make a git patch for usage
